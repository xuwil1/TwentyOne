			<h1>Rules for Blackjack</h1>
			<h2>OBJECT OF THE GAME</h2>
			<p>Participant attempts to beat the dealer by getting total card values as close to 21 as possible, without going over 21.</p>
			<h2>OBJECT OF THE GAME</h2>
			<p>Ace is worth 1 or 11, depending on if player's hand will go over 21. Face cards are 10 and any other card is its pip value.</p>
			<h2>THE DEAL</h2>
			<p>The dealer gives one card face up to the player, and then one card face up to themselves. Another round of cards is then dealt face up to the player, but the dealer takes the second card face down. Thus, the player receives two cards face up, and the dealer receives one card face up and one card face down. </p>
			<h2>BLACKJACK</h2>
			<p>If the first two cards of a hand are an Ace and a face card or "10" then it is a "blackjack".</p>
			<h2>THE PLAY</h2>
			<p>The player goes first and must decide whether to "stand" (not ask for another card) or "hit" (ask for another card in an attempt to get closer to a count of 21, or even hit 21 exactly). Thus, a player may stand on the two cards originally dealt to them, or they may ask the dealer for additional cards, one at a time, until deciding to stand on the total (if it is 21 or under). If the player goes "bust" (if it is over 21) or hits a "blackjack"(two cards with a value of 21), the player's turn will end automatically and go to the dealer's turn.</p>
			<h2>THE DEALER'S PLAY</h2>
			<p>After the player's turn is over, the dealer's second card is shown. If the total is 17 or more, the dealer must stand. If the total is 16 or under, they must take a card. The dealer must continue to take cards until the total is 17 or more, at which point the dealer must stand.</p>
